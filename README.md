# Revenue-Optimization-through-Operational-Improvements-The-Gyu-Kaku-Approach

## Project Overview

This project explores potential improvements in the operations of Gyu-Kaku, a renowned Japanese BBQ restaurant chain, through simulation-based analysis. The objective is to assess the impact of these improvements on the restaurant's revenue, using a variety of simulation models and strategic recommendations.

## Repository Structure

- **01_Simulation_Setup_and_Analysis.R**: This script sets up the initial simulation environment and performs the foundational analysis required for the study.
- **02_Revenue_Simulation_Models.R**: Contains the core simulation models that predict the revenue impact based on different operational changes.
- **Final_Report.html**: The final report detailing the methodology, results, and strategic recommendations.
- **Report_Template.html**: The template used for structuring the final report.

## Key Components

### 1. Simulation Setup
- Establishes the framework for the simulations, including defining parameters and initial conditions.

### 2. Revenue Simulation Models
- Implements various models to simulate the potential revenue outcomes based on proposed operational improvements.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Scripts**: Execute the R scripts in the specified order to replicate the simulation analysis.
   - Ensure that your R environment is properly set up and all necessary packages are installed.

2. **Review the Report**: The `Final_Report.html` provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including detailed explanations of the methodology, results, and strategic recommendations.

3. **Adapt and Extend**: The code and analysis framework can be adapted for other operational improvement projects within the restaurant industry or similar sectors.
